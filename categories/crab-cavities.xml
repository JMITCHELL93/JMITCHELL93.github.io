  For two years now I have been working on Higher Order Modes (HOMs) in crab cavities as part of my PhD.
  As you would imagine then, I have also been receiving the questions... 'what's a HOM?' and 'what's a crab cavity?'.

  I thought it was about time I wrote about this, if not solely to have a re-direct for these questions at anual family gatherings.
  After all, even Grandparents come pre-equipped with smart-phones and tablets nowadays
  ... maybe Mr Musk should stop worrying about AI and focus his critiques on the iPensioner?



  I have been fortunate enough to be involved in the HL-LHC project (WP4) at a time when the first two manufactured cavities have been installed into the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) for preliminary tests with beam.
  This has meant that in addition to electromagnetic design work, I have been able to develop skills in cavity testing, RF measurements, high power RF and even some mechanical aspects associated with cavity manufacture.
