  For two years now I have been working on Higher Order Modes (HOMs) in crab cavities as part of my PhD.
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  I have been fortunate enough to be involved in the HL-LHC project (WP4) at a time when the first two manufactured cavities have been installed into the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) for preliminary tests with beam.
  This has meant that in addition to electromagnetic design work, I have been able to develop skills in cavity testing, RF measurements, high power RF and even some mechanical aspects associated with cavity manufacture.
