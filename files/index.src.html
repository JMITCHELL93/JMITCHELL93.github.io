When you start using PYTHON, you realise there are a million and one ways to use the language and the initial hurdle can be overwhelming.
<br>
<br>
Additionally, when you work out which method you want to employ to use PYTHON, the best way to learn is to play with example codes and observe how changing paramters change how the code operates.
Therefore, I have set up a small area here to introduce Anaconda (software with Spyder and Jupyter - two fantastic PYTHON scripting clients).  In addition, there are some simple scripts which use some simple code to perform some common tasks for 'learning-by-play'.

We are all guilty of it...
<br>
<br>
Me: 'Ahh I once wrote a line of code which does that.'
<br>
Other person: 'Can I have it?'
<br>
Me: 'Ahh but it's somewhere in a code on a computer I no longer have.  So, unfortunately no.'
<br>
<br>
Therefore I have made myself this small text file for neat bits of code I always end up Googling.  It will be added to all the time and will grow with my python usage.

<h3><a name="Pole_Plotter">EM Multipole Plotter</a></h3>

This simple PYTHON code allows electromagnetic multipoles to be graphed as vector plots.
The code can of course be used for visulisation of electromagnetic multipoles and mode types but is also useful as an introduction to some basic PYTHON programming and techniques.
The code has been edited from an existing code online for which the references are provided as comments in the script.
