We are all guilty of it...
<br>
<br>
Me: 'Ahh I once wrote a line of code which does that.'
<br>
Other person: 'Can I have it?'
<br>
Me: 'Ahh but it's somewhere in a code on a computer I no longer have.  So, unfortunately no.'
<br>
<br>
Therefore I have made myself this small text file for neat bits of code I always end up Googling.  It will be added to all the time and will grow with my python usage.

<h3><a name="Pole_Plotter">EM Multipole Plotter</a></h3>

This simple PYTHON code allows electromagnetic multipoles to be graphed as vector plots.
The code can of course be used for visulisation of electromagnetic multipoles and mode types but is also useful as an introduction to some basic PYTHON programming and techniques.
The code has been edited from an existing code online for which the references are provided as comments in the script.
