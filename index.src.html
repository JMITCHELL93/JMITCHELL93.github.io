		<p> I am currently an Radio Frequency (RF) engineer based at <a href="https://home.cern/">CERN</a> in Geneva, Switzerland.  Currently I am working with High Power RF (MW level) amplifiers, resonant RF cavities (superconducting and normal conducting), broadband antennas and fundamental power couplers.  I am responsible for electromagnetic design using various software and programming languages, amplifier operation, amplifier maintenence, RF measurements and RF system upgrades.

      <h3><center>This site</center></h3>
      <p>This website was set-up as a project to both improve my Python/HTML skills whilst also providing an area for cataloguing information about myself, documentation and projects.</p>
      The site is generated using <a href="http://www.getnikola.com/">Nikola</a>, which is built by <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>.

      <h3><center>Skills</center></h3>
      <p>I am an RF/Electronics Engineer with skills in RF design (cavities and filters) and RF measurements.  During my projects and experience thus far, I have been involved with the design, build, testing, operation and maintenance.  I most enjoy the challenges associated with bringing a concept to reality and have developed a lot of experience in 'desgin-for-manufacture'.</p>
      <p>As well as my personal software, measurement and programming skills (detailed in my <a href="../GeneralDocumentation/JMitchell_CV.pdf" download>CV</a>), I enjoy collabaoration and learning from others and believe this aspect can be equally as important as technical profficieneis. </p>
